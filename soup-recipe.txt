A vegetarian chicken noodle soup recipe adapted from a (non-vegetarian) recipe by Tyler Florence.

Ingredients
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
2 medium onions, chopped
6 garlic cloves, minced
4 medium carrots, sliced
4 celery ribs, sliced
8 fresh thyme sprigs
2 bay leaves
1-14 oz. package extra-firm tofu, frozen overnight, thawed, pressed for 30 minutes (I use the
Tofu Xpress), and cut into bite-sized pieces
4 quarts no-chicken broth
12 oz. dried wide egg noodles
1/2 c. fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Instructions
1. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, carrots, celery, thyme and
bay leaf. Cook and stir for 3 minutes; add tofu. Cook for an additional 5 minutes or until
vegetables are softened, but not browned.
2. Add broth and bring to a boil. Once the mixture is boiling, add egg noodles and simmer for 8
minutes. (The noodles will be slightly undercooked, but don't worry--they'll continue cooking
after removed from heat. This way, the noodles won't be mushy.)
3. Season with salt and pepper and garnish with parsley before serving.


Notes
No-Chicken broth and bouillon cubes are sold at Whole Foods, natural grocery stores, and many
supermarket chains. If you can't find either of these, you can use vegetable broth
